771,Australia,1,Advertising online gambling is a no,"Big fan of Instagram. I have been for years. It is my preferred social media platform and my primary creative outlet. 

However, these past weeks I've seen again a flood of advertisements which is annoying. But one particular type has left me asking if I want to abandon using Instagram altogether.

The ad in question is for an online gambling app, it had a prominent Pharoah graphic like a slot machine. 

I just don't even know where to begin with articulating how disturbing this is to me.

As an Instagram user, I trust that when I use your app, it's safe, the community I'm exposed to is a safe and respectful one, and most importantly, it's a place for creative expression, inspiration and many other positive things Instagram has come to symbolise over the years.

Ads.
Online gambling.
To a community whose users may not even be at the legal gambling age.

And for me personally,
as a individual, 
as a corporate professional, 
as a creative user on Instagram,
as a member of a warm and wonderful community of content creators,
My response is a clear and resounding NO.

Online gambling has no place here, real money or otherwise. Not even promoting the behaviour that could prime others to accept it, or to diminish it's potential to devastate people on every level in the name of 'entertainment'.

NO.

Seriously guys, there needs to be a standard. Surely there are limits to what is deemed acceptable and unacceptable, suitable and unsuitable ad that you will accept fees for. Clearer definitions, rules and guidelines on what is okay for Instagram for the sake of it's users, and to protect the Instagram brand by ensuring you associate yourselves with those that align to your brand.

Guys, I implore you - fix this.

Promoting online gambling by way of advertising to line your company's pockets just isn't one of those things you want Instagram to be remembered for.

Please fix it.",bug report,negative

925,United States,4,Show Me The Waze (updated review),"UPDATE TO REVIEW: the current version of Waze (as of 05/08/17) almost always needs to be closed and reopened for the maps to fill my phone's screen. 
 
 UPDATE TO REVIEW (05/08/17): what happened to the notifications of other Wazers finding road reports helpful? The thumbsup and red ""it's not there"" reporting icons are still there, but I don't receive the notifications in my inbox letting me know other Wazers found my reports helpful. 
 -----
 
 I absolutely love this app. I've used Waze and my Garmin (updated maps) at the same time, and Waze, in my opinion, is much better because I have fellow Wazers out there alerting to road hazards, police sightings, current gas prices, and so forth. Personally, I don't need voice-assisted routing (in most cases); therefore, I mute my Waze app - no alert sounds, etc. Keeping in mind that all apps, programs, etc., have glitches from time to time, I wish reporting incorrect addresses could be done differently and easier. On more than one occasion, I've had Waze direct me to a rural business only to find out that the business is, for example, .5 miles further down the road. 
 
 Not a complaint, but it would be nice if we had more ""moods"" to choose from. Also, I'd like a way to add friends without allowing the app access to Facebook or my contacts. 
 
 Great app though. I use it every day for my commute to and from work - the police trap reports are invaluable to me!! I recommend Waze to all my friends.",requirement,neutral

1149,United States,5,If only it was its own company!,"Instagram, is an incredible tool that gives more to people's fingertips than they might realize. 
 
 Instagram is owned by Facebook, and in my eyes that deserves one star. I'm not here to bash, but let's be frank, Facebook already has enough money! But really, I'm here to review what I think Instagram could become and what it can do for you already, as well as, provide you with a short synopsis of how it has benefited me.
 
 For starters, I've been using Instagram for nearly 5 months and I have amassed almost 3,000 followers. The reason for this is simply because of the simplicity that Instagram is formed around, post pictures, videos, and watch it grow into something special from all the support. I'm talking about friends who support, strangers who support, and eventually you might just have yourself a very popular account. 
 
 Now, Instagram does have other programs associated with it that help enhance the experience such as, boomerang & layout. These are tools to simply help engage more with the experience and to make it unique.
 
 So why does the title read, ""If only it was its own company"" ? Well the simple fact is, Instagram, in my eyes, could be the single multi media/ social media platform that combines with Snapchat, Facebook, and others to have in one place, rather than 5 or more. 
 
 Social media won't be dying, it has become the new way of life, so let's see what we can do in terms of making our social connections a bit smarter, and compacted for simplicity reasons! The less we have to worry, the better we are as a society.

This app was a total torture in the month that i used it, never got stuck in such bad congestion before. For example in toronto Don Valley Parkway (freeway) gets very congested during rush hour and instead this app recommends taking more city streets, however this ends up being even worst as the city is always backed up due to redlights, heavy pedestrian presence and public transport. it's much better sticking with google maps (online with traffic) less complicated directions.

No split view option
No retina quality for ipad users
No quickly available 'deep dig' options for finding FoF 
No info map style smart display to follow who has hearted your pics.
How many clicks to find the # key? Four. Four clicks.
Why just square photos. Even the most basic mobile device in today's world can use apps to take images up to 7mp and edit then to achieve a no quality loss, professional level image

And the keypad!  Even my five year old thinks it's old and horrid and not nice. Was it designed by Mr. Magoo?

A Pinterest style interface and viewing platform would be a huge improvement.

1852,Hong Kong,4,Good app but have lot of scope for improvement,"This app is good although it's bit expensive. The biggest advantage is that it has huge database of food so tracking calories is much easier. I've used couple of other apps for diet tracking where I couldn't find many foods so had to create my own foods. Here I didn't have to create my own food. Also has lot of useful blogs. 
One clear disadvantage is that the database for calories burnt by doing exercise is very very poor. I've been exercising for many years and have my own database so I'm using that. But not many people will have that. So the developer must work on this.
Then the calories adjustment for walking, running and stairs climbing doesn't seem to be as good as other apps. 
Further it needs to have data capturing from other fitness apps even from competitor apps.
It would be good have direct link with other social media. Although I don't use it, other users may find it useful.",requirement,positive

I'm thinking that we have grown apart over the years. We have been through lots of ups & downs. Seen memorable events together and shared some life moments. 
But recently you changed. You only wanted to tell me about your ""top stories"", things you thought I wanted to hear- you no longer wanted to share everything with me. 
I want to hear everything like it used to be. Nice and easy. From start to end. 
I fear that if you and I can't  resolve this... It may be the end of our friendship. 
So Facebook, please think about it, I'm not sure if I'm ready to close the book on this part of my life.
Regards, Edward.",requirement,negative

2. The resting heart rate is too high by five beats most mornings. It seems to have started around the time of the last software update.

This is disappointing to say the least. I lost a week worth of steps trying to get to the bottom of this.

2944,United States,3,"Many things to like, but some major frustrations, too.","I've had a few different ""fitness"" bands, although I mostly use them for sleep tracking and waking up without an audible alarm. The band itself (I have the Charge 2) is decent, works as described. For tracking steps and heart rate, it's what I need. 

For sleep, there are issues. First of all, I prefer to actually turn on the sleep mode. I've had this option on other bands. You tell the band you're going to sleep, it automatically turns off any vibrations or sounds to avoid disturbing your sleep, and tracks how long it took to fall asleep. The Fitbit app has no such function, but instead does ""sleep detection."" This does not work at all. It always shows me falling asleep at least 90 minutes later than I actually did. And, I have to remember to turn notifications off, and then turn them back on when I wake up. They recently upgraded their sleep analysis. I like the new analysis much better, but the app keeps switching back to the old one for no apparent reason. It bounces back and forth - a few days with the old approach, a few days with the new approach. The results are quite different, so this bouncing back and forth makes it impossible to compare sleep quality from one night to the next. 

I travel a lot, and the time zone doesn't update very well. This should really work much better.

Update 6/13/17-
On a recent night where I had a lengthy sleep interruption, neither of the 2 separate sleep session showed any sleep stages. 

Also, often my hourly step count does NOT match between my Charge 2 and the app. Today my Charge 2 exploded with stars for meeting my hourly step goals for the day, but the app only shows 9 out of 10 hours even after syncing multiple times.

2964,Canada,4,So far so good...,"This is day 2 for using this app. I was working with the ""My fitness pal"" and found it more user friendly in terms of food intake tracking - you are able to access a breakdown of fats, carbs etc and there is the option to add recipes for tracking that I found much easier to use. I do like the bar code feature on this app as well as the link for suggested workouts with the ""Fitstar"" app. This app also sync very easily to my fit bit and make it extremely easy to keep an eye on my activity, water intake and sleep. Overall great app!!",other,negative

2973,Canada,4,Missing some features but awesome,"I love that the Fitbit app counts the percentage of Macros you eat in a day. However, I would like it if it showed you in grams for better calculations of each. 

I also wish all the challenges weren't step related. It would be fun if you could challenge friends to workouts (so many minutes or heart rate zones per week) and active minutes rather than just steps.

The adventure section is lacking. I'm a Canadian and so the Yosemite hikes or New York hikes are useless to me. But it was a cool idea. 

Wish it synced to the health app, but it's by no means a deal breaker for me. 

I'd still recommend for someone like me who is beginning their fitness journey or wants to start being more aware. This isn't the device or app for hard core fitness people.",requirement,negative

The app is top notch easy to use and has many options for the time clock face. You can input food, water intake, and it does the rest! Monitors my heart rate, steps, calories, and much more. Also provides special monitoring of exercise events for low and high moments in workout. The device even has breathing exercise for calming moments, as well as mini workouts it offers up to increase opportunities when you have 5-10 minutes to fit in a workout. The in depth sleep monitoring reports really provide a real good break down of my sleep periods. It has controls on the device itself to control your music play while listening! It's well worth the price. Popping out the module for charging is easy and gets you back up and running for 5 days after a 2 hour charge. Love the SMS & inbound calling notifications I get on my device screen. Easy to use and well made, I even enjoy being able to change the clock screen from a workout stat view to a more elegant nautical or traditional clock face when going out to dine or dressing up.

Plus I could actually afford it. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles and but it keeps track of everything that is important to me. I love the phone app and really enjoy checking in to see how many steps I've gotten each day.  I love that it knows when I'm asleep or active. 
The only reason I'm giving it a 4 is that it's not waterproof and it doesn't last a whole week on a charge. I guess I could get the flex 2 to solve those issues, but I'm not willing to spend the extra money, so really, it's just about perfect.",requirement,negative

For this, i don't see posts many of my friends have, and see other posts I don't care about that were over 2 weeks ago.

This new algorithm is a nightmare. I am scrolling through my feed and seeing posts for 4 and 5 days ago. Please stop! Had to remove some stars for this. 

Original review
I wish you could edit the text on a post. Sometimes you make a typo and the only way to fix it is to delete it and do it again. Also, what happened to editing a video?!  Used to be able put multiple pieces up and now can't?!?!  Please out that back!

Also, do NOT allow for reposts!  There are times I would like to repost, yes, however some people repost so many things it floods the feed and it's annoying. That happened on vine.

3194,United States,2,Disappointed,"I Don't like the new random feed at all. Makes it impossible to keep up with those I'm following.  I really enjoyed the previous format where lists were in chronological and time posted order. It was more user friendly. With the old format, I checked Instagram often throughout the day. Now I don't even want to check it or post because the new format makes it impossible to pick up where I left off.

3210,Canada,3,Fix the home page!!,Instagram is a great app but the main problem i have is that the posts are not in chronological order on the home page. It just makes no sense to me. I dont want to see a post from 4 days ago that ive already liked when there is other content im missing because of instas selective feature. It makes me feel like i am missing out on a lot of posts and i hate that so much. Everyone hated that feature when it first came out and i know a lot of people still really dont like it... i just dont understand why instagram chooses to disappoint and frustrate their users!!

But one thing I will ask Instagram is that why don't you listen to your customers??  It's simple as that. People for months and months have complained about your algorithm story line, saying how it's not something they enjoy and they want to have an option to turn their story to chronological or algorithm. Is it that hard to have it as an option? Seriously you're in the top 10 apps in the App Store and android store. At least try to make your customers a little happier. That's all I'm asking for, listen to us. Thank you.",requirement,positive

Serving size and serving weight choices when logging a food. One food might give you one single option, example; chicken breast, serving size? ""One breast"". Other foods might give you choices like ounces, grams, etc. but only give you an option up to 100 and fractions to 7/8.

3644,United States,3,Excellent Tracking ~ Terrible Crashing Issues,"I rely on MFP every single day; I log morning, noon and night. It's a great method of calorie counting and I love having the ability to customize so many things to my lifestyle; such as creating recipes, creating exercises, and adjusting MACRO's. However, community plays a very large role in fitness and this App is terrible at maintaining a solid platform for community banter and communications. Teamwork is a valued asset for athletes and when friends are attempting to motivate each other thousands of miles apart, they must be able to rely on their social media capabilities. This App crashes constantly, it delays news feed updates, sometimes for days which makes supporting your fellow teammates extremely frustrating. By the time you see their accomplishments the excitement or activity has already come and gone. The App also glitches frequently when attempting to upload pictures, and often times will not allow you to upload anything at all when working with progress pictures or news feed images. In addition, there are ZERO pre-programmed strength exercises available - which for Bodybuilders like myself is extremely limiting when attempting to monitor our daily caloric burn.

I will of course continue to use this tool as it has become second nature for me to log daily, I am a fan of UnderArmor, and the app is, for the most part, user friendly. But, be aware that Friday through Monday the App basically ceases to function on anything related to community communications; the food and exercise diary seem to work at all times with no problems, but there is definitely room for growth.",requirement,negative
3645,United States,3,Useful but tedious,"This app is great for making an educated guess about your calories intake. That being said, maybe it is a premium feature, but it doesn't seem obvious how to customize your diet. For example, I eat vegetarian and so when I type in a mock meat, I first get animal products which are obviously incorrect for me, and this would be so, so useful to eliminate some of the tediousness out of finding your foods. 

Also - there's so many more types of yoga than just two, and it burns way more calories than offered.",requirement,negative
3646,United States,3,Needs net carb calculation,"This app has always worked well for me in the past. However now I am doing a low-carb diet plan, and the app forces me to manually enter my net carb count. I think this app would come to the next level if it had a low-carb meal plan option/setting that automatically calculated net carbs rather then accounting for total carbs. I won't be able to use this app until this change is made because I don't have the time, patience or energy to manually enter my net carbs for every food I eat.

3649,United States,3,Difficult Layout Design,"My Fitness pal, by far, has the best, most accurate food tracking list. I have been using this app for years, and after recently upgrading to premium, I have some issues with the layout and design of the app. My Fitness Pal was an excellent tool to track simply calories, however I now follow a strict ketogenic diet. I appreciate how I can adjust the macro grams to suit my dietary needs, but the layout of this app truly limits my food tracking. In a ketogenic diet, you measure ""net carbs"", which is essentially total grams of carbs minus total grams of fiber. Currently, there is no option to show net carbs, requiring me to do the subtraction. This is not difficult, however it could be a great feature one could 'turn on'. 

Another improvement could be to the water feature. I would love if I could set a goal for the amount of water I drink in a day, and see the amount of water as a fraction (i.e. 32 oz/100oz), so I can manage my water intake more easily. Or, even better, see a water bottle graphic that I could ""fill with water"" as I drink throughout the day.

My final suggestion is that My Fitness Pal is neither easy to navigate, nor aesthetically pleasing. This alone makes tracking food a chore. The bland user interface takes away from the app. There is a difference between something that works, and something you enjoy working with. In My Fitness Pal, everything works, however I don't enjoy the experience due to the uninteresting design, that has been that same for 5 years. A beautiful new redesign would be highly beneficial and increase the experience for all users.

 I appreciate My Fitness Pal for the unmatchable food accuracy and help on my journey to heath! I hope this review helps!",requirement,negative
3650,United States,3,"Overall good, but annoying bugs","I really like My Fitness Pal as a calorie tracker. It makes it super easy to keep track of what you're eating, especially with the bar code scanner. The weight log feature and new progress pictures feature are both really good too. I also love that you can see your calorie breakdowns and macros. It gave me a reality check about what was actually in the foods I'm eating. 

The issue that I have been having with it is with logging exercise. Every time I try to log my exercise, I enter it in and it initially shows the calories burned then they go away just as fast. I haven't been able to find a way to fix this and I'm getting pretty frustrated, especially since sometimes it happens and sometimes it doesn't.

For example, two days with same caloric input, but one with few steps and one with 10000 steps will log the same caloric output. It assigns caloric value of exercise per some  weird algorithms. 

Still probably the best option out there for tracking input.",bug report,neutral

3669,United States,4,Good but...,"Entering meals and recipes is still cumbersome after all these years.
I stopped using MyFitnessPal a few years ago because it was just too much work to enter foods. I've returned because I am using Fitbit and Fitbit is more inadequate in that arena. 
Example of MyFitnessPal weakness: entering recipes into recipes. Let's say you have various ways of preparing ground turkey; burgers, meat loaf, tacos, spaghetti sauce, etc. the basic turkey seasoning would be one recipe and the sauce might be another. In these cases it would be  more efficient to include one recipe into another. This could have multiple variations and builds on the basic. A somewhat recursive recipe builder. Salads would be another less complex example. 
Either, it's not possible in MyFitnessPal or it's really NOT intuitive. I haven't found a way to do this. Someone, please let me know if you've found out how.
One more thing... foods don't transfer to Fitbit; only total calories and it's not a two way street. Why Fitbit allows this predatory relationship, I have no idea. Fitbit is much more accurate on calories spent and caloric balance.
So, MyFitnessPal, why haven't you improved after all these years?",requirement,positive

3688,United States,4,Good app with a fairly comprehensive database,Best food diary I've tried and integrates well with Garmin connect too. One problem is that it's crowdsourced and so many people are lazy and only input calories. That's not enough info and just makes it harder to find items that match up to what you really ate. Don't let people publish to the universe of users unless they include at least 3-4 categories of nutrition or some other validation. It would help those of us looking for real data.

3690,Hong Kong,4,Good app but have lot of scope for improvement,"This app is good although it's bit expensive. The biggest advantage is that it has huge database of food so tracking calories is much easier. I've used couple of other apps for diet tracking where I couldn't find many foods so had to create my own foods. Here I didn't have to create my own food. Also has lot of useful blogs. 
One clear disadvantage is that the database for calories burnt by doing exercise is very very poor. I've been exercising for many years and have my own database so I'm using that. But not many people will have that. So the developer must work on this.
Then the calories adjustment for walking, running and stairs climbing doesn't seem to be as good as other apps. 
Further it needs to have data capturing from other fitness apps even from competitor apps.

3770,United States,2,Works for CICO but app is horribly slow and laggy,"I completely support ads for free apps/software but poor control by the developers of this app is causing problems.  This app not only has ads in its feeds/blogs/screens (which is acceptable) but it will pop open ads which take you completely out of the app until you click done or force close the app.  It will also happen in other apps if this app is open in the background.  I'm starting to wonder if Apple should be taking a look to see if this app is violating terms of the App Store.  If they fix the ad pop-outs it would be a good app again, until the. If you install I'd be sure to force close it when not in use and use it on a PC as often as possible instead.  Otherwise it's the best calorie tracker out there with the largest database.  Annual subscription is very expensive for an app.

Update:  the app honestly has got worse.  It's actually so annoyingly slow now because of loading times between screens (I assume because if ads) that I find myself avoiding the app if I am near a PC.  Using MFP on a PC with a web browser is much faster.  I would think they would have done improvements on speed and in fact the last few updates say so but I just don't see it.  If I could scan barcodes on the web version I'd delete the app.  Reducing the rating to 2 stars for no real improvement since the last review.  Whoever is coding this app needs supervision.  Do you even use the app?  I have the latest and greatest iPhone and upgrade it every year so it shouldn't be my device.  Other apps are 10x faster.  Doesn't seem to matter if I'm on wifi or LTE, lag between screens/tasks in this app is almost unbearable.

One good thing is that ad hijacking seems to be gone for now.",requirement,negative

3793,United Kingdom,3,Don't update - ruined by ad placement,"If you haven't updated for a while, don't. As per usual, along with a few unnecessary changes they've added banner ads right in the middle of the food diary blocking a lot of the screen. It's fairly common for apps to introduce ads after its gained in popularity, especially for 'free apps'. However the blatant ad positioning here greatly impacts the usability of the app and is a careless design.  I expected more consideration from an app endorsed by Under Armour. 

Personally I haven't found the update worth the inconvenience and annoyance of having an ad staring at you every time you log in, so if you haven't already, I wouldn't bother. 

Also, the designers have unnecessarily increased the spacing around the food entries meaning you now have to scroll significantly in order to see your whole day. I don't see any benefit to the extra white spacing and seems a wasteful use of a real real estate. This is of course made worse by the fact the middle inch is now taken up by ads as well making the app cumbersome to deal with. 

I had enjoyed using this app, but with these additions I now find it frustrating every time I open it and I no longer want to use.",requirement,negative
3794,Australia,3,Has potential,"A pretty good app but has some irritating limitations:

3795,United States,3,"Very useful app, great database","I started using the app because I start a diet with a nutritionist. I really like I can see what nutrition has each food and it helps me make better choices (not just calories)
I think there is space to improve though.

3797,United Kingdom,3,Really helps,"Great app. Really helps track calories in food to help keep me under my limit. Seems to be working too. Would consider premium but it's too expensive for what you get (√Ç¬£40 a year is way too much) so either reduce the cost or give far more for the premium version.

Also noticed crashing recently (app freezes) and poor quality info when scanning items. If you can't rely on the database without having to double check each item is correct then it's a problem. Sometimes stops counting iPhone steps or removes them all together when you add exercise (e.g. A run )

So a bit buggy with data issues and premium costs way too much (especially with the issues)",requirement,negative
3798,United States,3,Good app but some big bugs and spam,"Have been using for some time. Great way to track calories consumed and exercise. However some significant disadvantages - Lots of spam; in-app ads launch links without permission and MFP makes it nearly impossible to report; paid upgrade adds few advantageous; even more features are available but requires overpriced monthly subscription; syncing can be inconsistent and problematic - worked at first, the didn't, now seems to work again but different than it worked originally. I recommend but think MFP needs to address these issues. 

Update - the problems with ads has been addressed to a large extent. Ads launching links without permission happens only occasionally now. Still having some issues with syncing, however, despite the related UA Record app having the information.

- Many of those photos are posted by online and physical real world retailers - Double Awesome!
- Sadly, clicking many of the links associated with the photos results in landing on error pages, unrelated sites etc. not the retailer's site/Amazon/eBay as you would expect.

3972,United States,4,A never-mentioned suggestion...,"I love love love Pinterest. I really do. There are only two problems: 

1.) I have the ""picked for you"" setting turned off, but I still keep seeing a ton of pins on my main feed from boards that I do not follow :\ 
2.) It is a major task to delete pins that I no longer want on my boards. Sometimes I like to do a ""spring cleaning"" of my boards by going through and deleting hundreds of pins that I don't like anymore, but it takes forever because I can only delete one pin at a time, and it's a whole process just to delete them. I would love if there were a ""select pins"" option where I can select more than one pin at a time and delete/move them to another board all at the same time.
 
I would love to see these things fixed in the future. Thanks!",requirement,negative

Maybe not a toll free number but at least the option to chat similar as to when you are placing an online order & they have the chat option in the right hand corner.

4039,United States,1,No,"There's honestly more adds than there are actual things I'm interested to pin. You got rid of the like button and now I legit have to make a new bored whenever I fine something I remotely like. Also what's with this 200,000 pin limit? I'm fairly new as I had joined last year and I've never heard of that. To be honest that's extremely stupid as I use Pinterest as a source of motivation and to get my brain thinking with writing prompts and drawing ideas. If I got to that point that means basically losing everything I have built up until now. So here are my suggestions by you know of course I don't expect you to use them considering you would probably go against everyone's wants and keep on making it horrible. But that is on you. 

1. You should bring back the like button. It helped me know (at least) when I've already pinned something or seen something. Also because it put all the likes into a little folder for you to go throw later on. 

2. You should remove the 200,000 pin limit. Like why is that even a thing? That really does make it hard for people who use your app for inspiration. 

3. Less adds. Honestly since this has been getting updating more and more I'm seeing more and more adds. Not even adds for things I would be interested in anyways. Just random pointless adds. 

Anyways these are just my ideas and I'm sure other people have more ideas and have a better way of explaining why for each one, but I would like to be a voice to help bring back that gosh darn like button.",requirement,positive

???? I have no idea why anyone would do that. Sometimes I liked to heart pins but not pin them for whatever reason, or I would use the heart as an indicator to if I had seen that particular pin before.

Do not update your app if you enjoy seeing the basic information about the pins in the home feed. They took away who pinned it, what board it was pinned to, or the caption. You have to click on it to see anything which is a waste of time. All they show you is a picture of the pin. You can't see what pins people ""liked"" on their profile.

4183,United States,1,Used to be my favorite!!!,"***update***
Since Pinterest decided to remove our like button, I've tried finding something else, so I'm going to delete my account & just save my stuff on instagram, where I can like & save what I love (I don't have to see the same pins on my feed all the time, bombarded by ads)! & I know instagram would NEVER make the mistake of removing the heart button!!! Maybe if the people at pinterest give me my heart back, I'll get an account again. Thanks for the wonderful experience while it lasted! It was my addiction since its launch! I almost felt depressed because y'all removed the heart/like button. I even feel like I'm wasting my time with this review, but oh well!

Pinterest is no longer enjoyable! Not interested anymore. Thanks for ruining what was once my addiction √¢Àú¬π√Ø¬∏¬è",requirement,neutral

4187,United States,2,These changes are awful!,"**UPDATE**
With every update I use this site less and less! Now with no more likes, I probably will barely use it anymore. I used likes to like stuff I saw quickly, then I'd put them into their specific boards later when I had more time. What's the point of having a Likes Board if it takes exactly the same amount of time as just putting it in the right board in the first place? We can make our own private boards! This is so so frustrating, especially because I use this app for work pretty often.

-----
OMG stop with the horrible updates!! If I'm pinning something from my likes, why would I need to be reminded every single time that I've already saved it to my likes? Isn't that what the red heart is for?! And get rid of those RIDICULOUS white circles please!

-----
This app is getting so frustrating! I woke up to find the You and News tabs are all together now. So not only do I have to know what other people have liked and saved, I have to sift through all that just to get to my own notifications. It makes it so hard to know what kind of an impact you have on your followers. Plus, I don't want anyone to know what pins I've liked, that's what pinning them is for. It was so much better when you took the like button away so I didn't have to pin everything to a secret board.

Another thing that is kind of making me want to give up, the ""picked for you"" pins. There's more of those than pins from people I actually CHOSE to follow. I miss so much stuff I'd have saved because I have to go through so much I don't even care to see. The pins are generally similar to what I search it they're the mediocre version, and they're the pins I saw when I did the search in the first place. Why would I search for something and then want to see ALL of the same pins on my homepage? Especially if it's something embarrassing!",requirement,positive
4188,United States,2,stop taking away features!,every few months pinterest takes away great features!  it used to be easy to see all the other users who pinned a item.  now its gone!  but why? it makes zero sense.  this feature was often the only way to find and get to other users interested in a certain subject.  please restore this feature.,requirement,negative

This was by far the easiest way of finding similar ideas, and it being removed seems trivial and unnecessary. In addition, the sudden lack of a like button seems contrary to every social media system already pioneered. When you have a image sharing device, you have a like button, that's just common sense.

4227,United States,3,Obsessed pinterest user here,"I had to take a break recently from pinterest, because as we all know it can be a bit addictive. I come back to pinterest this week and find there are a lot of features i used to use and love are now gone. For instance, the ""like"" button. The name or company that shared a pin is no longer under the pin itself. Before i took the break from Pinterest i had noticed my notifications no longer showed me EXACTLY what others repinned of mine. It just told me that a pinterest user repinned my pin to this album. What pin? I liked seeing what people thought was interesting or enjoyed out of my pins. Now I don't know. That's weird. And i really dont care what my friends pin on their boards IN MY NOTIFICATIONS. I follow them, don't I? So why aren't their pins showing up in my pin feed? Why did these changes happen? I have been waiting patiently for the notification one to change back to what it used to be cause i now find it odd and annoying. And the new changes of the like button (so I don't have to read it right away or commit it to a board) and the names of those i follow appearing under the pins they share. Please stop changing this app ""for the better"". I don't enjoy it as much as i used to. 

One positive note. I like the ""i tried it"" feature. It's helpful to hear how others benefited from the pin or found it not useful. 

Otherwise, give us back the Pinterest we all know and love and please use focus groups with REAL obsessed Pinterest users and not just web designers/marketers or whomever you are using for advice. 

Thank you.

Dissapointed Pinterest User",other,negative

4230,United States,3,Give us back the old Pinterest,"I used to love Pinterest. I still do, very addicted to it, but so much has changed. First off, the ""tried it"" button added is useless - especially for artwork since that's basically copying other people's work without permission. Also, why we're the likes taken away? Now there's just a board called ""Your Pinterest Likes"" and it's stupid. So now I just have to pin everything? I have to search for the likes board and pin it whenever I like something? Why can't I just like on demand like the way it used to be? Lots of other little details were added and I highly dislike it. At least bring back the likes, please.

Except now your just making constant turns and trying to avoid pedestrians. If you have a 15 mile drive or more, check how long the drive will take an hour before you leave, you will get a higher number when you do leave. Then take the time that it tells you you will arrive as soon as u get in your car, and add about 20-30 min. I live and work in New York and used to depend on waze to give me ETA's, but after being wrong, every single day. Literally every single day on the way to work and the way home, by 20-30 min each time this app just isn't worth it.

4331,United States,2,Two things people want fixed the most..........,"I've been using Waze for years now even before the UI overhaul. It's still the same great app but there are two things that most everyone complains about now that need to be addressed asap.

1. Arrows for traffic flow direction. The old UI had it. Now there is some sort of slow moving line with rounded tips. The rounded tips are barely noticeable. If they were bolder arrows, it would be easier to see what direction the lines are moving in. If the other side of the road has traffic, the traffic flow lines are too close together and it's almost impossible to tell what it what.

2. Hard to navigate to Directions or other tabs in the app. I understand making it as similar as possible to the Maps default app is important, but the Maps default app is flawed. Improve upon it.",requirement,negative
4332,Australia,2,Has potential but....,"First, it needs to use km's in countries other than USA. Next it needs to accommodate driving on the left in places like Australia.

I do LOVE being alerted about police since they are so oppressive here in Aus, but being able to report them once in a safe (and legal) place to do so would be great.

4341,United States,2,"Wifi disconnect, constantly loading/stalling/freezing","I've been a big proponent of Waze long before the Google acquisition, and overall, it's a great app. I'm not one to typically write reviews, but as I opened the app this morning to head into work, it asked me to share what I thought of the app and to write a review.

What bothers me most about the app is when I'm attempting to put in an address as I'm driving away from home/work, and waze cannot load the directions in a timely enough fashion that prevents me from heading in the wrong direction, usually. This is because I'm connected to wifi and as I drive away, the signal becomes weaker and therefor Waze stalls and persists to try and load the directions until it freezes, crashes, or until I've taken a wrong turn. I have turned on wifi assist on my iOS which is supposed to help this, but it does not.

Update: Latest version has partially improved voice directions. I get part of the distance information but it gets cut off at end. This happens when listening through Bluetooth device.

Update (6-28-17): Latest version is still cutting out distance information on some turns. Battery is being drained while in use. Plugging in use to break even but not anymore. Still don't like zero warning when changing to a ""better"" route.",requirement,negative

It often sends me to these directions and i'll have to wait forever at a difficult left turn on a two-way traffic street.

4383,United States,3,Good...but could be great!,"I want so bad to give Waze a five star review, but I just can't. I'd be lying. 

I drive for a living, and Waze is my go-to GPS app, even though it has a few flaws. For starters, it sometimes (maybe 10% of time) gives me directions that make no sense. I've messed with the settings for fastest/shortest route, but it doesn't seem to matter. Also, there have been a lot of glitches lately, like login/account problems, crashing, and screen malfunctions. For those reasons, I knocked off one star. 

I knocked off another star because of poor service, poor updates, and poor communication, as I've emailed Waze a number of times only to get a generic, computerized response in return. 

All in all, it's a very good navigation tool. It will get you where you want to go, and with the help of other wazers, it will notify you of potential problems along your route, which is the main attraction to the app. But it has the potential to blow every other GPS app out there completely out of the water. It just needs some developers who care and will listen to their users. After all, the users are what makes Waze different from the rest.",bug report,positive

4392,United States,4,Love it... but for a few missing Google Maps features,"Waze is very bad at the search of well known places than Google Maps search is. It would be very nice if Google would add its map search to this wonderful user contributed data we participate in on Waze. Recently, I have started using Google Maps more as a result of it, and sometimes poor navigation on Waze... may be due to lack of total search database available to Google Maps.

4398,United States,4,"Big fan, but I still double check routes","Dropped to 4 stars for only one reason: occasionally users reports generate a detour that is actually slower. I travel interstate a ton, and when the road gets jammed because of an accident a detour can save you up to an hour. If Waze tells me to detour I always check Google Maps. Waze actually added an hour to my trip when Maps showed only a 10 minute delay. 

It is still my first mapping resource and I am slowly reducing my use of google maps over time. Maybe more Waters will help make the app more accurate?",requirement,neutral
4399,United Kingdom,4,Brilliant Sat Nav,"This app is great but doesn't always check to see if there is a quicker route when traffic builds up ahead so you have manually do it instead on route.

One bad point is when you get sent a link to follow someone's route, after a short duration of time it disappears so you can't track them anymore which is annoying. You still receive notifications etc though when they are about to arrive. Odd",requirement,positive

Good app, but the graphic user interface (GUI) is sorely lacking a good design.

It needs a better color palette more cohesive to traffic/satellite geological route indicators (red route line=heavy traffic, green or blue route line=less congested route...). Also, remove some of the numerous on-screen icons which can be a distraction to a driver.",requirement,positive
4413,Australia,4,Always uses location services and therefore drains your battery,My only criticism for this otherwise excellent product is that it doesn't have an option to only use your location when you're using the app. Other than that it is an intelligent and accurate way of reaching your destination.,requirement,positive

Waze always takes you the fastest route, tells you when there's construction, accidents, objects in the road & CHEAPEST GAS PRICES!! My favorite thing about this app is that it tells you where the cops are.. it'll tell you if they're hiding with their radar gun or on the road driving around.

4451,United States,1,Never communicated,I tried to plan a trip and it failed to communicate,bug report,positive
4452,United States,1,"Borderline Unusable, I will be looking elsewhere for car nav","Waze really let me down on my last trip from NYC area to Washington DC.
 First of all they have a long standing audio issue is that they NEED to put a delay when their audio starts up in Bluetooth.
 On certain OEM car radios, mine included (it's a Subaru) the first part of the audio gets cut off because Waze starts too early. This was noted in a feature request, the response is that is it is ""a car manufacturer'sissue"". What do they expect me to do?, replace my car stereo? 
 
 When I approached DC , the uplink to their Database must have cut out because I got a warning that there was no data connection.I reset my iPhone and tried again , with no success.I had to switch to Google Maps to complete my trip.
 
 On the return trip, Waze could not compute a route to my home.Again , I resorted to Google Maps, which worked fine.When I went back to Waze , which later was able to figure out how to get to my house, itcaused my iPhone 6S to overheat and go into thermal shutdown.At that point I removed it from its Otterbox case so that it could run a bit cooler. 
 
 The final insult came when it routed me through GW bridge and the LIE rather than alternate routes to get to my home on Long Island.This added HOURS to my return trip.Without using any Nav system I would have taken an alternate route which I suspect would have been no worse and most likely much better.
 
 Due to these problems I will not consider Waze for any long trips and will use a different Nav app or a dedicated GPS.
 Waze , you need to address your issues, starting with the Audio which is low-hanging-fruit.",bug report,positive
4453,South Africa,1,Useless,Today is the second time this app claims a route is free with normal traveling time while i know for a fact the road is totally closed.

4461,United States,1,Not Happy with Waze,"I'm extremely displeased with Waze for including in the most recent versions of the app only Location Services options ""Never"" and ""Always,"" but not ""While Using the App."" Honestly, Waze has no business using my location at all times and creating a geo-fence.

4465,United States,1,USED to be good. I repeat USED TO BE!,"I downloaded this app a long time ago. I've sang its praises to everyone I meet when the topic of driving comes up. Lately(?), since the beginning of 2016, up to today (April 15, 2016), it is a mere shadow of what I remember. Not sure if the latest Apple updates to iPhone are the reason, but the app seizes up EVERY time I try to use it. Just now I tried to get the routing from Nanuet, NY to Hagerstown, MD. It calculates it but stays on the screen to accept the route. Freezes up. Force stop. Restart. Try again. Same thing. It happens CONSTANTLY. iPhone is up to date and I see NO issues with any other app. However, the fact that Waze did this BEFORE any phone upgrade was needed tells me it's not a phone issue. Maybe take a few less ads? Google Maps here I come. RELUCTANTLY..... JUNE 15, 2017 UPDATE: STILL SUCKING! Can't calculate a route 106 miles away???!!!! ALWAYS an ERROR MESSAGE OF SOME SORT!

4467,United States,1,Always Uses Location Services,"Why does this app keep using location services when I'm not even using the app? What does it care when I'm at home or work and not going anywhere? Why does it insist on draining my battery?
 
 I like using it when I'm in a car. I don't think it needs to be on while I'm in the shower. 
 
 I have to turn on and off location services every time I use this app and it's annoying as heck. Otherwise I get the purple triangle. 
 
 Location services should only be in use ""while using app"" like every other sane app out there.",requirement,positive

4470,United States,1,Horrible navigation,"All waze does is try to keep you moving, even if that means telling you to make a dangerous left turn onto a super busy street in the middle of traffic hour.

 Today, for example, Waze gave me three options to travel a trip that only takes 10 to 15 minutes, there were no traffic issues. The app suggested that I take three very obscure routes one that would take 22 minutes, another that would take 25 minutes and the third that would take 1 hour and 4 minutes

4483,Canada,2,poor route guidance during rush hour,"I find that this app has very poor shortcut and guidance routes in rush hour. i think its algorithm tries to avoid straightforward routes to avoid backups however not only are its route congested, they are also slower than google maps directions. for over a month i logged my usage with waze vs google maps and in the end i give the nod to the latter as its routes are more straight forward and also overall faster. This app was a total torture in the month that i used it, never got stuck in such bad congestion before. For example in toronto Don Valley Parkway (freeway) gets very congested during rush hour and instead this app recommends taking more city streets, however this ends up being even worst as the city is always backed up due to redlights, heavy pedestrian presence and public transport. it's much better sticking with google maps (online with traffic) less complicated directions. The only advantage this app has over google maps is show of police traps however not always are these accurate.",requirement,negative

4485,United States,2,Adequate power hog,"This review is in respConse to numerous pop ups wanting a review to spread the word. Ah, evangelicals.
 
 Waze is adequate, although it has sent me on more than one far, far out of the way circuitous route. It has a real voracious appetite for power and is a serious battery drainer. 
 
 Beyond that it never seems to shut down on command. So, it continues to guzzle more 'fuel' than an ill timed Escalade. Invariably I am forced to completely shut down my iPhone, then wait for it to reboot to shake Waze awaze. That is not convenient. 
 
 On balance in a ratio of useful to problematic, the usefulness quotient is outbalanced by the pain in the neck elements. Hence, I don't often use the app.
 
 To further diminish my fondness for this app, it seems to be rejecting my two star rating. I've 'sent' numerous bits of feedback this morning re other apps, however, this Waze review is refusing to 'send.' I'll keep trying.Ahhhhh, perseverance paid off, I think.

4489,United States,2,"Hasn't gotten smarter, ads ruin experience","Don't get me wrong, I love Waze and it has saved me many times. But it has only gotten worse and worse over time. 
 
 It makes me take crazy detours filled with side streets, turns, lights and crosswalks just to save under 1-2 minutes of time... not worth it. You should be able to compare routes ans choose the one you want to take. It also can't consistently recognize where you can U-turn especially when you accidentally head the wrong direction, instead forcing you to ""go around"" and drive a lot more than you need to. The ads are extremely annoying and damages the user experience as a distraction. Pretty sure most people don't care for the ads. Finally, the app often takes forever to load and identify my location and the route, especially when initially starting it up. And I never have that issue using Google Maps.
 
 This has caused me to switch back to Google Maps often. Until Waze addresses these things, I'll continue to use Google Maps as my go to navigation app.",requirement,neutral
4490,United States,2,Could be better,"Distance measurement in this app lags behind Garmin -- it will show much bigger distance than in reality and I'm constantly finding myself making last-minute turns. If you live in a busy city it can add to your frustration.

4493,United States,2,Is losing its appeal...,"The directions are generally good. It's the instability and unreliability of the ancillary functions that are the most disappointing and frustrating, i.e. communicating with and following another driver's trip.

The directions took me on a street where I should've gone straight for a couple miles, but this app made me make a left and then an immediate right down an alley way.

 The ability to crowd source reported patrolman, disabled vehicles and road closures is the primary positive of this app.
 When calculating alternative routes the algorithm is wildly in accurate at times. Not all the time but many times routes will be displayed that are completely irrelevant to the starting and ending points of trips. And yet when you get close to a landmark that would be a deciding factor in time or hassle saved the app does not recalculate a different route consistently.",bug report,positive

 Edit to add: I don't know what happened but with the last couple of update the app has been acting kind of wonky. It's not quick to respond to where you are on the road and it drove me around in circles a few times where it had before. I had to reduce my rating from five stars to three because of this.

 Loved the old Waze not so happy with new updates!! Hard to view not driver friendly!! Change back!!!!

4519,United States,3,Love/Hate,"I have a serious love hate relationship with Waze. I love its traffic and road hazard alerts, it's routing, and the little speedometer that lets you know when you are over the limit. 
 I don't really mind that it occasionally seems to perform experiments on you and send you on nonsensical detours. 
 What I hate is that it really really wants to know your location all the time. Rather than letting me choose ""allow location services only when using the app"", I have to go through a song and dance in the app every time I finish using it. If I forget, having the GPS on kills the battery in my aging 5s. Sometimes location services stay on even with the song and dance, and I have to turn off location services in settings. Failing to turn LS back on before opening Waze sends Waze into a tizzy. 
 But for the location services headache, Waze is a 5-star app.",requirement,negative

4528,United States,3,One BIG flaw,"I love everything about Waze with the exception of one BIG thing in my opinion. We'll get to that bit first let me mention a few things I love. Firstly, love how it feels like a community. App is updated by other users. I myself have paved new road and reported map issues. Love the notifications. Knowing that a police is hidden ahead or there is an object in there road has saved my but plenty of times. My gripe is there fact that unlike other GPS apps, Waze uses my location services ALL THE TIME. When I'm not using the app it shouldn't drain my battery.

4535,United States,4,One of the best,"Very easy to use and is always updated. Of the thousands of times I've used the app it took me the wrong direction twice.

4543,United States,4,Recent changes,So I love this app for the real-time reporting but I guess it was the most resent update that changed the voice alerts from saying things like vehicle on the shoulder ahead to hazard reported causing me to have to look down to see what kind of hazard... or instead of saying stay left to I-75 N it just says keep left which can be confusing in some locations... if it could go back to how it was before that would be great :),requirement,neutral

I am a taxi driver and I use this app all day long and now it has become so annoying to use that I might as well move on to something else.
Ads have increased!!! It is so annoying that the app keeps trying to guess where I'm going. Going home? Going to work? Stop! I'll tell you where to go and when I'm ready to go. I use it all day long in my job and it is becoming really annoying. Recently I went into a shop and when I came out the app asked me if I was going to a certain place, which was the wrong place and I didn't realise he asked me that, so it reprogrammed itself automatically and sent me completely in the wrong direction. I wasted an hour.

Something to consider in future updates:
Driving up north on Waterloo Road, Macquarie Park towards Macquarie Shopping Centre I'm guided a weird way onto Herring Road to turn around and get into the shopping centre, when I could just turn right into it. I'm sure it has to do with the fact that each location only has on destination; in this case one entry, which is rubbish for a shopping centre, park, sports venue etc.

It's great when there is really heavy traffic in as much as it will find you an alternative route using lots of small residential streets to avoid the traffic so at least you keep moving. However, it also wants to take you on these insane routes when there is no traffic and it actually makes your journey longer and stressful. It doesn't take into account the fact that the streets in London are narrow and you have to keep stopping and even reversing to allow other vehicles to pass, as well as the fact that all of these streets have speed humps running the length of them also that at the end of each of these streets you have to stop and wait to allow traffic to pass before exiting the junction. It's just unnecessary to cut off a corner because it may save me 15 seconds. I've been a taxi driver for 16 years in London so I know the roads, too many times I've ignored waze and taken my own route and actually reduced the ETA by up to 15 minutes!

4774,United Kingdom,2,Great but still need essential improvements,"As before, the app is great and there has been some very good improvements recently. A few essential improvements remain necessary:

MUST HAVE:
1. Let me choose to see the picture of a friend which I put myself in the iphone's Contacts app. Certain people keep changing their profile picture, it's funny but necessarily helpful.
2. Let me choose to rename a group chat just for me, without the others seeing it. This is quite essential for group discussions. One example among others: I have a group discussion chat with my wife, my sister and her husband. The only name we can give to this group is something in common, so: ""Their family name-Our family name"". It would be much better that we be able to choose to see only their family name and they see only ours. This is true with all in-laws but also friend's couples, or even group chat when you haven't chosen the group's name (you could end up with 2 group chats having the same name, for example).
3. Please let us write messages to someone for whom we only have the phone number, and is not in My Contacts.

NICE TO HAVE
4. Please let me create a ""one-off"" group discussion, not meant to last, i.e. do not force me to give a name to the group discussion, which makes it too formal.
5. Specific alerts/notifications linked to keywords. For example, let's say I am part of a big chat group, there are too many messages so I put on silent, but i still would like to receive a notification if someone writes my first name or nick name.",requirement,neutral

Another thing, one of my group chats show 2 contacts for the same person when you see the group's info about the participants. If you go down the list of participants in the group, the would be 2 people with the number 9756 4835, and another 2 people with 8045 7265(for example). I know my explanation might not be that clear but please try to fix this:)

Also, could we have the same colours for the same contact names? Different colours for the same contact names in different chat groups are a bit confusing. 

Before I forget, could we include a search function that lets you search for messages at a specific time, or day please?

Last thing, when we want to clear our chat's messages in the part in the settings which tell you about each of your chat's specific storage usage for each chat group, and lets you choose to delete only certain parts of the chat, could we add the option of not deleting starred messages? As in an option that lets you delete your selected ones(e.g. Text & photos) but cancels out your starred messages, resulting in only unstarred messages being deleted(in this case would be unstarred texts & unstarred photos).

This message it deleted took a long time to compose. I made sure to write it very early morning before dawn as it's highly unlikely for anyone to call me at that hour. Before all this Facebook synchronizing crap √∞≈∏‚Äô¬© it never acted up with such disappointment. The little flaws here and there I lived with for years, as no one and nothing is perfect! √∞≈∏‚Äò≈í This here is a whole other level of deleting my message. Like I said it did it many times, but because the others were much shorter messages I just kept trying until it worked. The thing is, it doesn't always do it, therefore you have no idea when it's gonna occur. Please do something about that. I'm so not in the mood to write all that again. Now my friend will never know!!! SMFH √∞≈∏¬§¬¶√¢‚Ç¨¬ç√¢‚Ñ¢‚Äö√Ø¬∏¬è",bug report,positive

Been using this feature for years and it suddenly started doing this multiple times this week! Will change my review to five stars if this issue gets fixed!!,bug report,positive
5033,United Kingdom,3,Spotlight search doesn't work :/,"I've had this app for time but for a while I've been hella low on storage space. So while I was using the app it just shut down and I opened it back up again and it said it was optimising, or trying to back up my chats and restore it from ICloud or whatever so I was like okay. But when I opened it up the current days worth of messages were gone. All the ones before it was still there from yesterday onwards though. The main concern is my spot light search. I tried to search for a word to see if my messages from way back were still there but all that came up was contact and group names. Before it would be all three I think. I need to search for words the most. I find spot light search for certain words quite convenient and it's recently been quite annoying that I'm unable to use it. I'd really appreciate if whatsapp would address this problem. Thanks.",bug report,positive

5037,United States,3,Just bring back the Address Book,"I actually miss the ""contacts"" option. If I want to see which users use WhatsApp, I have to go through the motion of writing a message, or I can go through the motion of placing a call. Both methods aren't ideal. 

The status or daily uploads of my contacts should be marked by a green circle around their photo. Let me see it if I talk to them regularly.",requirement,positive
5038,India,3,Issues with the photos grouped,"Though it's a great idea to have the pictures grouped, there are glitches. The pictures aren't opening with ease. There's a lot of lag and it tests one's patience for sure. Immediate rectification is needed.",bug report,positive

Basically, it seems that the apps only have 5 tabs and the new ""status"" tab (which is not a popular function, at least I don't see 99.9% of my contacts use it)and the camera tab took over the contacts tab.....
although FB bought over whatsapp, it should maintain its own character & uniqueness but nowadays the whatsapp & messenger are basically the same, can the R&D team be more ""creative"" and don't make these 2 apps the same",bug report,positive
